    import traceback

    def f():
        g()

    def g():
        for line in traceback.format_stack():
            print(line.strip())

    f()

# Prints:
# File "so-stack.py", line 10, in <module>
#     f()
# File "so-stack.py", line 4, in f
#     g()
# File "so-stack.py", line 7, in g
#     for line in traceback.format_stack():
If you really only want to print the stack to stderr, you can use:

    traceback.print_stack()
Or to print to stdout (useful if want to keep redirected output together), use:

    traceback.print_stack(file=sys.stdout)
